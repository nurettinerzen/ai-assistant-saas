            GATE-level assistant test failed at ${{ github.event.repository.updated_at }}

            🚫 DEPLOY BLOCKER - Critical functionality broken:
            - S1: Order status & verification flow
            - S2: Hallucination resistance (non-existent orders)
            - S6: Identity switch protection

            This is a GATE test - must be fixed before deployment.
